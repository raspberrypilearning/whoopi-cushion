## What you will make

In this resource you will make a whoopee cushion powered by a Raspberry Pi. You can use it to play pranks on your friends, family, or teachers!

In the bad old days before TV and computers, the most popular form of family entertainment was the whoopee cushion, a tooty balloon originally made from a pig’s bladder. The whoopee cushion would be inflated and hidden under grandad’s chair cushion. When he sat down, it would make a loud "PARP!" noise, causing him to jump into the air and making his false teeth fly out. It was the best thing ever (especially when the dog caught the teeth and ran about wearing them and grinning). This project brings the whoopee cushion up to date: there's no bladder and no need to blow it up. Thanks to the Raspberry Pi, you can also add whatever noises you want!

## What you will learn

By creating a whoopee cushion with your Raspberry Pi you will learn:

- How to make a paper plate button to trigger an event
- How to program the GPIO pins using loops, lists, and variables
